My dears<p>Q: (L) And who do we have with us this evening?<p class="answer">A: Hifaa<p>Q: (L) And where do you transmit through?<p class="answer">A: Cassiopaea.<p>Q: (L) Well Bruce has some questions so I'm going to take Bruce's questions first. Bruce asks, Is the concept of Orgone energy as rediscovered by Albert Pike the same as the Odic Force as presented by Baron von Reichenbach?<p class="answer">A: Yes.<p>Q: (L) Is understanding the Scottish rite helpful in understanding and using this energy?<p class="answer">A: Not really.<p>Q: Is orgone the energy used to power the pyramid at Giza?<p class="answer">A: No.<p>Q: (L) Is orgone the energy used to power Stonehenge?<p class="answer">A: No<p>Q: (L) Can orgone energy be used to cure disease?<p class="answer">A: Helps.<p>Q: (L) Is it the same energy used in the silicon wand that you have previously discussed?<p class="answer">A: No.<p>Q: (L) Is silicon needed to use orgone energy?<p class="answer">A: No.<p>Q: (L) Can orgone energy be used to activate the part of the DNA that has been burned away or deactivated by light?<p class="answer">A: Not necessary<p>Q: (L) Okay, is the geometry of the Elder Futhark alphabet helpful in harnessing orgone energy?<p class="answer">A: No.<p>Q: (L) Is the orgone energy concept helpful in completing Unified Field Theory?<p class="answer">A: Portal necessary for UFT, orgone is universal.<p>Q: (L) Is orgone energy the same force that was discovered by the Vril Society to develop propulsion into outer space?<p class="answer">A: No.<p>Q: (L) Is this Odic Force the same that emanates from crystals as used in Atlantis?<p class="answer">A: No, this has been covered.<p>Q: (L) Yes I know. Ummm...Did the Egyptians use this force with a metal head band wrapped around the forehead?<p class="answer">A: No.<p>Q: (L) Is iron necessary to use this energy?<p class="answer">A: No.<p>Q: (L) Does this force have a positive and negative component to it?<p class="answer">A: No.<p>Q: (L) Did Einstein acknowledge the concept of orgone energy?<p class="answer">A: Yes.<p>Q: (L) Did it help him with his UFT?<p class="answer">A: No.<p>Q: (L) Did the government use orgone energy in the Philadelphia Experiment?<p class="answer">A: No.<p>Q: (L) Can orgone energy be used for transportation from one spot on Earth to another?<p class="answer">A: No.<p>Q: (L) Did the Odic Force originate with the Nephilim?<p class="answer">A: No<p>Q: (L) I know these are silly questions. Did the Nephilim intermarry with the Tribe of Benjamin?<p class="answer">A: No.<p>Q: (L) Since Odic Force is Scandinavian is it involved with Sinclair and Oak Island?<p class="answer">A: Nonsense.<p>Q: (L) Did the Ark of the Covenant activate the Vril Force?<p class="answer">A: No.<p>Q: (L) Was it composed of gold and rutilated quartz?<p class="answer">A: No.<p>Q: (L) He must be reading some real trash. Is the Vril Energy the same as Kundalini?<p class="answer">A: No. Yes it is nonsense<p>Q: (L) Ah, Bruce is off on a tangent. He gets to reading these damn Dan Winter type things and he's just sure that he's found something that's going to tune him in. Alright, enough of that. Now, I suppose that we should ask some reasonable questions. We've already covered this WTC...Ohhhh! (A) I have a lot of questions about this pole shifting. Well go with your question. (L) That's probably where I was going. I was going off to Novosibirtsk. You once made the remark that the secret lies in a mountain pass in Russia and something about a line drawn between Novosibirtsk and Urkutsk. Is there a mountain pass in this area where something important is waiting for us to find it?<p class="answer">A: Yes.<p>Q: (L) Now according to these guys who are writing this web page about pole shift, they say it can be predicted where the poles will shift to. Is this in fact the case?<p class="answer">A: No.<p>Q: (L) Why can't pole shifts be predicted? Can't we know where the new pole will end up?<p class="answer">A: Chaotic function here<p>Q: (L) Okay, in a pole shift does the lithosphere of the planet slide on the core? (A) No. We have to be very precise. There are three possible things that would come under the name pole shift. Only one of them may come, or two, or three, okay? And these are the following -1) the axis of rotation with respect to stars is changing, straightening out for instance; this is one thing; while all the rest goes with the axis, the lithosphere and the magnetic field. 2) Second, the axis stays where it is, maybe it shifts a little bit; the lithosphere stays where it is - maybe it wobbles - but the magnetic field changes: for instance reverses. 3) Third, axis stays, magnetic field stays, but the lithosphere is moving. So that's three ways a pole shift can happen. And of course there are things that come together. The most dramatic one which is seen from outside is when the axis of rotation changes. The next dramatic one is probably when the lithosphere changes. And the third of unknown consequences is when the magnetic pole changes, okay? So, we want to have an understanding what will be the main change. (L) Well I guess we ought to ask an even more basic question: are we looking at a pole shift happening? That's starting at the beginning. (A) Alright. (L) In the next ten years. Is a pole shift possible in the next ten years?<p class="answer">A: Yes.<p>Q: (L) Is a pole shift of the axis...(A) Honey, you ask if the pole shift is possible, of course it's possible. But suppose it's almost zero probability? 'Is it possible' is not the right question. 'Is it going to happen?' That's a question. (L) Okay you ask, carry on. (A) Are we looking at a pole shift during the next ten or so years with a high degree of probability?<p class="answer">A: Yes.<p>Q: (A) In this concept of pole shift, what would be the main feature of this pole shift, of all those which we were discussing?<p class="answer">A: New axial orientation, and magnetic reversal.<p>Q: (L) That's fairly dramatic. (A) Alright, now, change of axis or orientation of axis of rotation: can we say we would straighten up, getting almost perpendicular to the ecliptic? Or the other possibility is that it will fall down being almost parallel to the ecliptic. The third is that we'll flip completely by 180 degrees. We know it's highly unpredictable, but can we have a clue from which one is, so to say, dominate?<p class="answer">A: Perpendicularity will be restored.<p>Q: (A) We know the axis will change dramatically and magnetic reversal will happen. You didn't mention a change or shift of the lithosphere alone. Can we...<p class="answer">A: Lithospheric shift will feature to some extent.<p>Q: (A) But, that means eventually that the equator will almost not change because...<p class="answer">A: Correct.<p>Q: (A) So it will just shift a little bit, but its not going to go to Hawaii? (L) Oh rats! That was my theory! Well, it was a good idea. (A) What about changes in the lithosphere: can we predict a little bit of change in geography, coming from motions in lithosphere and changes in water level?<p class="answer">A: Chaotic features predominate but in general it will be safer inland and in mountainous areas since less folding occurs in such locations.<p>Q: (A) Now, the major, the change of the orientation of the axis, what would be the main trigger, force, or activity, or what kind of event will trigger this change of the axis?<p class="answer">A: Cometary bodies.<p>Q: (L) Are the planets of the solar system going to kind of shift out of their orbits and run amok? Is that a possibility?<p class="answer">A: Yes.<p>Q: (A) Due to cometary orbits alone?<p class="answer">A: Yes. Twin sun also.<p>Q: (A) When we speak about these cometary bodies, are we speaking about impacts?<p class="answer">A: Some will hit.<p>Q: (A) What would be - if any - the role played by electric phenomena?<p class="answer">A: Twin sun grounds current flow through entire system setting the "motor" running.<p>Q: (L) Does this mean that all of the different bodies of the solar system are like parts of some kind of giant machine, and once this electric current flows through them, depending on their positions relative to one another at the time this current flows, that it has some influence on the way the machine runs?<p class="answer">A: Yes, more or less.<p>Q: (A) I want to ask about this magnetic pole reversal. It's the current theory or understanding of magnetic field of planets in terms of dynamo mechanism, where there is a liquid metal - iron - which is hot - there are convective currents, and there is self-excitation through magnetic field. That's the present model. They were able to model this magnetic pole reversal using this kind of magneto-hydro-dynamics. Is this model essentially correct?<p class="answer">A: Only partly.<p>Q: (A) What is the main thing that is important, and that is lacking from this model?<p class="answer">A: Crystalline ammonia core.<p>Q: (A) Everybody thinks that the core is a crystal iron; that's the present thinking. Say it's an ammonia core: is an ammonia core in all planets with magnetic fields? Is this so?<p class="answer">A: From this perspective, no but from the perspective of organic life, yes.<p>Q: (A) When we speak about crystalline ammonia, do you mean a new kind of crystalline ammonia that is not yet known on Earth to our scientists?<p class="answer">A: More or less.<p>Q: (L) I think we need to find out something about this crystalline ammonia. (A) What would make it go into the very core? (L) I don't know. We don't know enough about it to even know how to frame a question. I know we thought it was crazy when they were talking about Jupiter and the ammonia, and then of course all this ammonia shows up on Jupiter. And I remember them saying something about this at the time, but I don't think we ever followed up on it because I thought it was even to crazy to think about. Maybe we need to find out something about ammonia, crystalline ammonia. (A) Is there a mini black hole in the center of the Earth?<p class="answer">A: No.<p>Q: (L) I remember when I was a kid - this is a funny thing - we got this kind of chemistry experiment. You put these chemicals together and it grew crystals. I think ammonia was part of it. I think you had to use ammonia to grow crystals. (A) Okay, now this crystalline ammonia core inside the Earth, can we have idea how big it is, what radius?<p class="answer">A: 300 km.<p>Q: (L) What is surrounding it, what is the next layer? (A) Normally people would say it's an iron crystal. What is the next layer?<p class="answer">A: Correct.<p>Q: (A) There is this ammonia - crystalline... (L) Surrounded by iron crystal. Is it crystal iron? (A) Probably at this pressure that is here, it may very well be crystal. (L) Okay, is the iron surrounding the ammonia, is it crystalline?<p class="answer">A: Yes.<p>Q: (L) What's the next layer?<p class="answer">A: Molten iron.<p>Q: (A) Okay, now we know that some planets have this crystalline ammonia, and some do not. When we consider planets that have this crystal ammonia inside, how did it get there? Was it a kernel first around which the planet was formed, or first the planet was formed and then during some processes the ammonia sank and crystallized inside? I would like to know how it got there?<p class="answer">A: It is the natural formation process for ammonia to accrete iron from supernovae.<p>Q: (L) I read somewhere - about supernovae - that the only reason we have iron is because it's produced in supernovas. That would mean that our solar system is formed from a supernova, right? In which case what blew up and when? (A) I understand that this crystalline ammonia core - 300 km radius - must have certain magnetic properties which are important. Because it was mentioned that it was lacking in dynamo theory or certain very important properties concerning heat convection. So there are these two main things in dynamo theory - conductivity and electric properties - on the other hand heat convection properties. Why is this ammonia important for the magnetic field because of what properties?<p class="answer">A: Super conducting.<p>Q: (A) According to what we know it's very hot inside the earth because of the pressure. Now, is this ammonia also hot, as much as iron?<p class="answer">A: Grows alternately cold and hot.<p>Q: (A) Is it super conducting even if when it is very hot?<p class="answer">A: No.<p>Q: (A) When it gets cold, how cold does it get?<p class="answer">A: 55 degrees below absolute zero.<p>Q: (L) What is absolute zero? (A) That is something you can't get below. That's why it's called absolute zero. It's a new thermo-dynamics. (L) How often does it alternate?<p class="answer">A: Close to hour long periods.<p>Q: (L) So when it gets so cold and becomes super conducting, the act of super-conducting is what heats it up? Is that it?<p class="answer">A: Yes.<p>Q: (L) Well once it heats up, how does it then get cold again?<p class="answer">A: It stops conducting.<p>Q: (L) What is it conducting? When something is super conducting what does it conduct?<p class="answer">A: Electrons.<p>Q: (A) The point is, you see, that when something is super conducting it offers no resistance. Which means that the current it flows through it, is not heating it. Well we learned that it gets hot because it's super conductive, right? Which is somewhat contradictory because when it is super-conducting there's no reason for it to be hot except it can become hot because there is the hot external shell of iron. So that is very likely why it would become hot. Because by the very definition of super conductivity you don't become hot when you conduct, see? Well, if there are big, very big currents, then okay, they can stop super conductivity, then it gets warm.<p class="answer">A: Currents of this nature set the surrounding iron to vibrating which produces heat, not heat produced by the current.<p>Q: (A) Now, I want to go back to this 55 degree below absolute zero. And here I would like to have a confirmation of this 55 degree below zero. Because. according to the current knowledge of physics, the absolute zero was set by definition, as the temperature on the scale, according to the science of thermo-dynamics, which is - so to say - nothing moves so you cannot go below this temperature. If you say 55 degrees below zero it means we have to redo physics and redo thermo-dynamics.<p class="answer">A: You have entered a different realm.<p>Q: (A) What?<p class="answer">A: Lack of movement as measured by physics is based upon 3rd density conventions.<p>Q: (A) What causes this appearance of new physics in the center of the planet? We do not see this need for new physics around us. But somehow there are specific conditions, apparently, in the center of the planet that cause necessity of entering this new physics.<p class="answer">A: Windows.<p>Q: (L) Let me ask this, if it was possible to measure a temperature of something that was being subjected to a very intense electro-magnetic field what would it show? (A) Well the question is different, you see, because we asked first about why there is this ammonia crystal inside, okay? The answer was it was a natural process. But now we see there is this window inside. What is the reason that there is this window inside? Now you suggest, honey, that the widow inside is because there are - or because who knows what causes what - but there are very strong electro-magnetic fields. Is the window inside related to the fact that we have to go beyond standard physics? Is it related to the fact that there are very strong electro-magnetic field inside?<p class="answer">A: Reciprocal function.<p>Q: (L) What is ammonia composed of? (A) Ammonia? NH3, one nitrogen and three hydrogen atoms, and it kind of rotates, and that's ammonia. (A) What is nitrogen number? Six? Or seven? Seven is phosphorus, yeah? (L) I don't know, I don't remember, I'm too tired to remember. (A) You're too tired.<p>Q: (L) We haven't received any offers, you said we'd get an offer and we should do something.<p class="answer">A: Soon, have faith.<p>Q: (A) Yet, I would like to know what can we do, how can we change our focus, priorities or something, to make it come sooner? Should we?<p class="answer">A: You are doing just fine.<p>Q: (L) Okay, anything else we can think of we ought to ask before we...is there going to be any kind of terrorist attacks tonight or tomorrow?<p class="answer">A: Not likely.<p>Q: Are there going to be any further terrorist attacks in the United States?<p class="answer">A: Possible but not probable.<p>Q: (L) What is the next...can you give us clues about the next major significant event in our lives?<p class="answer">A: Light will break in a big way.<p>Q: (L) Well that's pretty amorphous. What kind of...(A) Lightening strike?<p>(L) Yeah, are we going to get another lightening strike (laughter)? Alright, well, anything that we should've asked that we didn't ask?<p class="answer">A: Love one another.<p>Q: (L) Well, that was kind of...okay, I'm too tired. Good night, thank you.<p class="answer">A: Goodbye<p>End of Session</div></br></div></section><section id="1626480000"><div class="main"><h2>Session 17 July 2021</h2><a href="https://cassiopaea.org/forum/threads/session-17-july-2021.50782/" target="_blank">Forum discussion</a></br></br><div>Session Date: July 17th 2021<p>Laura, Andromeda, and Artemis at the board<p>Pierre, Joe, Chu, Ark, PoB, Scottie, Gaby, Niall, Noko the Wonderdog, Princess Leia<p>Q: (L) This is Saturday, July 17th, 2021. The usual suspects: [Review of those present] Here we go...<p class="answer">A: Hello to all from Cassiopaea.<p>Q: (L) And who do we have with us?<p class="answer">A: Prioeiae will do.<p>Q: (L) Alright. Do you have questions, Joe?<p>(Joe) I've got a few. First one is about Jordan Peterson. Was his illness last year a result of some kind of direct attack?<p class="answer">A: Of course. He is not fully aware.<p>Q: (Artemis) Did whatever attack him get ahold of him in some way?<p class="answer">A: As usual.<p>Q: (L) Well, 4th density. They beam them, make them weak and sick and break them down. They activate attackers to come against you. Wear you out...<p>(Joe) What is actually happening in the arms of these people who become magnetic after an mRNA vaccine?<p class="answer">A: Hematies.<p>Q: (Pierre) The cells containing iron.<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (L) So it causes something in the body's own iron to collect?<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (Joe) Is something sequestering the iron?<p>(Pierre) Because iron sticks to the vaccines, and if you have iron in your body it won't stick to iron. How is this hematie magnetized?<p class="answer">A: Magnetite.<p>Q: (Pierre) Magnetite is a rock that's naturally magnetic, but...<p>(Joe) Does that mean it's in the vaccine?<p>(L) Is it in the vaccine, or is it something that accumulates from within the body itself?<p class="answer">A: Body.<p>Q: (L) Is there something psychic about it?<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (L) So it's not purely a physiological reaction?<p class="answer">A: No. Nano particles act as antennae for strange waves which then send signals to the body inducing modification on the next level of physicality.<p>Q: (PoB) What are strange waves?<p>(Pierre) We have to assume that in the next level of physicality, entities are magnetic.<p>(L) Now, what?<p>(Joe) What do they mean by 'next level of physicality'?<p class="answer">A: So that 3D tech can then operate more efficiently. It does not work as well with everyone it is used on.<p>Q: (Joe) Strange waves... I dunno.<p>(L) What do you mean by 'strange waves'?<p class="answer">A: Nothing in 3D is relatable.<p>Q: (L) So it's like a 4D wave... Are you saying this is like a 4D wave that, by way of these nanoparticles, is able to cross the border between 4D and 3D?<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (Joe) So are they saying that the magnetism is ultimately like paraphysical in a sense? The weird thing is how any function in your body can produce such a strong magnetism from a tiny little... 1 mL of whatever...<p class="answer">A: There is much about the body that is still unknown.<p>Q: (Joe) So there are things that the body can do or produce that can be switched on by these strange waves that are received by nanoparticles in the vaccine.<p class="answer">A: DNA can be upregulated in specific regions and perform specialized functions.<p>Q: (Andromeda) What's the difference between the people this works on and the people that it doesn't?<p class="answer">A: Usually DNA damage.<p>Q: (L) But not always.<p>(Joe) That's weird.<p>(Andromeda) So it's kinda paraphysical. It changes the DNA for us, but...<p>(Joe) It's creating superpowers in a certain sense in individuals. Not very cool superpowers, but...<p>(L) Well, I guess it's like some of those people you've read about. They have spoons stick to them all over their body and so on. It's probably because of their DNA. It's active in them for some reason just spontaneously.<p>(Chu) But that would assume that the pharmaceutical companies producing them are aware of this technology? Or is it a byproduct?<p class="answer">A: Byproduct partly.<p>Q: (Andromeda) So maybe they were intending to cause some change in the DNA for control, and it just so happens that it's the same function that does this magnetic thing.<p>(L) They may have intended one thing, but it's actually being used in another way by 4D critters. Maybe they were induced to construct the vaccine the way they did for these other reasons without necessarily knowing the full implications of what they were doing.<p>(Pierre) Like a back door.<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (L) A back door, exactly.<p>(Joe) The nanoparticles that are used in the vaccine, there's been talk of graphene oxide. Is that one of the types of nanoparticles that are used?<p class="answer">A: One but not all.<p>Q: (Gaby) Will the group members that will be or have been vaccinated with this technology, can they do something else to protect themselves?<p class="answer">A: Your program is good if combined with knowledge and awareness. Knowledge itself changes DNA.<p>Q: (Joe) So if the ultimate reason for this technology being used in 12% of the vaccines is to influence people at some point in the future, it's only people who would be inclined to act in that way anyway who would be susceptible to it. It won't work in people who aren't of that nature.<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (L) Is it possible that one of the reasons human beings have been deliberately dumbed down is to prevent positive DNA changes?<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (Joe) And the culture?<p>(Ark) But I don't understand. Are these effects for just one vaccine, or for every vaccine?<p>(Joe) The mRNA ones.<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (PoB) Some of these videos look obviously fake. What percentage of the videos of these magnetic effects are fake?<p class="answer">A: 70%<p>Q: (L) Well, there are a lot of people out there spreading disinformation and stirring things up.<p>(Joe) Yeah, and people on social media just used it to get attention.<p>(L) Every time something like that comes up, there are so many copycats. They just HAVE to jump on the bandwagon so they can get views on their videos.<p>(Andromeda) Exactly. They don't have anything better to do!<p>(Pierre) I have another question about DNA. In previous sessions, it was mentioned that you Laura and Joe for example had a dozen or more DNA strands. Are these extra DNA strands of a material nature?<p>(Joe) No.<p>(Pierre) Do these extra DNA strands have electromagnetic properties?<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (Pierre) Do they act in a fractal way?<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (Pierre) Do they enable a 'deeper' access to the information field?<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (L) You could have answered those questions yourself.<p>(Joe) Yeah. In the last session when we mentioned it, they talked about that.<p>(L) I swear, Pierre, sometimes you look just like Gurdjieff. You need to use mascara on your mustache. [laughter]<p>(Joe) That's your extra DNA strands making you look like Gurdjieff. [laughter]<p>(Pierre) Well, it was not obvious to me. It took me years to think about it.<p>(Joe) Well, it was said in one of those sessions that they weren't of a physical nature.<p>(Ark) Can I ask a question? Are eyebrows antennas?<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (Ark) Antennas for what?<p class="answer">A: Information.<p>Q: (Artemis) So is the hair on your head.<p>(Pierre) Any protein.<p>(Chu) All proteins are antenna for information.<p>(L) I knew there was a reason I liked big hair! [laughter]<p>(Andromeda) And gentlemen get more hairy as they become older and wiser.<p>(L) Well, they replace the hair on their head with hair in their nose and ears. [laughter]<p>(Joe) If it's all proteins, that means all proteins in your body as well.<p>(Pierre) I have another question. Officially, 44% of the French population got 2 jabs of the Covid vaccine. What is the real number?<p class="answer">A: Close enough.<p>Q: (Joe) That doesn't surprise me.<p>(Pierre) Probably the difficult thing is to reach above 50%.<p>(L) And we know about half the people are zombies.<p>(Joe) They're terrified.<p>(L) I'm surprised it's not 54%.<p>(Pierre) 54% is for one jab.<p>(Joe) Macron's statement the other day basically about segregating the population and discriminating between the vaccinated and unvaccinated people, he was the first leader in the 'free world' to say that. It's quite a draconian move. I wanna know what is the deal with France leading the charge into this overt tyranny. Why does the French government appear to be leading the charge of instituting a tyrannical society? I'll offer an answer: Is it because the French people are perhaps a bit more inclined towards resistance to vaccines?<p class="answer">A: Close<p>Q: (L) So they want to get them subdued as quickly as possible.<p>(Joe) Does it have anything to do with us being here?<p class="answer">A: Partly.<p>Q: (Joe) What are the chances of this segregation of society between vaccinated and unvaccinated people being successful in France?<p class="answer">A: Not high. Other events may intervene.<p>Q: (Joe) The other day, he said that if you're not vaccinated, you can't go to a restaurant or bar or café. You can't even sit outside.<p>(Niall) Or go and buy food.<p>(Joe) You're not allowed IN to big supermarkets.<p>(Andromeda) Wherever 50 or more people gather, you must have a vaccine passport to enter. So basically if you're not vaccinated, you wouldn't even be able to go grocery shopping.<p>(Chu) And the vaccine passport can't be faked. If you're not vaccinated, you have to have a PCR test and upload it to a site that gives you a QR code. No more paper forms.<p>(Niall) And you pay for it now. Every time you want to see a doctor, you pay 200€ for the test first.<p>(Andromeda) You can't go to a hospital, no eating outside at a restaurant anymore...<p>(Joe) Macron declared it the other day.<p>(Chu) He announced it, and the social security web site has it up as if it's a done deal. They vote on July 19th, and then it'll be approved in August.<p>(Gaby) Children above 12 years old must have the Pfizer vaccine.<p>(Niall) No returns to school without an mRNA vaccine this September.<p>(Chu) If you don't have a smartphone, you go to a pharmacy and they'll print the QR code for you.<p class="answer">A: The changes are near as witnessed by this desperate push for control.<p>Q: (Andromeda) After Macron's speech, even Merkel said, "That's not the way to do it. That's not the way to engender trust in your population!" Like: What are you, Nazis?! [laughter]<p>(Pierre) Events to come that might intervene, is it the Triple Bad Day?<p class="answer">A: Wait and see!<p>Q: (Scottie) Well, we can make a pretty educated guess at this point.<p>(L) So the crisis is going to spin out of control?<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (Pierre) Because of natural events?<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (Chu) Not because of people revolting.<p class="answer">A: Possible also.<p>Q: (Scottie) It's gonna be the Greatest Show on Earth. I'm tellin' ya, it's gonna be NUTS.<p>(L) A really big show!<p>(Pierre) I have a question about FRV. In reference to the Triple Bad Day, the C's added FRV also on top of pandemics, social unrest, and financial crisis. Is it because these people resonate only at low frequencies with the information field and because of the geomagnetic field weakening, their connection will be altered or severed?<p class="answer">A: Close.<p>Q: (L) So, next topic?<p>(Niall) What caused the apartment building in Miami to collapse?<p class="answer">A: Cheap construction.<p>Q: (Scottie) BO-RING!<p>(Chu) How anticlimactic...<p>(Pierre) They said the building was crap. It failed inspections.<p>(L) Anybody else have questions? Honey?<p>(Ark) No.<p>(L) Okay, I have a question. As you must know, I have expanded my reading experience into some different types of books. [laughter]<p>(Artemis) Why are they laughing?<p>(L) Okay, well, the reason I expanded was because it came up in the suggestions of books on Amazon. It was called The Russian Billionaire. I had seen all these other ones, I was never interested in any of that sort of thing. Modern day romance novels didn't really attract me. The question in my mind was WHY was the title The Russian Billionaire? Is it promoting something about Russia or Russians? How is this going to be treated in this book? What's going on here? Why is somebody writing about a Russian billionaire in a political climate where Russia is the evildoer of all deeds? So, I got this book on Kindle and I read it. I was really shocked that the author referenced Putin in a positive way. What was even more shocking was that the book started talking about transhumanism and the singularity and different things like that in such a clear way. Even though it wasn't explicit, it was implicit that the USA was kind of like the guilty party in this whole plot to take over humanity. So I was really surprised. But then when I got to the end, I realized there were other books that were connected to this book since it makes reference to those. There were people in this book that were made reference to that obviously appeared in other books. I wanted the complete picture, so I got the previous books and the subsequent books and read the whole set. I started thinking that this was really bizarre. Here's this author basically telling things like they are. But it's scattered through the story. I read a few others of that ilk and I realized that most of them are just pornography. They might not be hardcore, but they’re kind of pornographic because mainly they arrange some sort of story that is supposed to support the sexual episodes that are described in loving detail. In any event, I spread my net a little wider, and there are many that I'd never recommend to anybody. So, I want to know: Is this some kind of propaganda effort by somebody? Is Russia behind this propaganda effort to...?<p>(Joe) Don't say that on social media, Laura! They'll all believe you!<p>(Pierre) Russia or someone who wants to promote the truth.<p>(L) Well, I mean... Is this some kind of effort to... I dunno. What IS going on here?<p class="answer">A: Personal mission by a number of enlightened individuals.<p>Q: (L) So there are some people who know the score... Didn't you find out that this Georgia Le Carre woman only started writing these books in 2014? And she's written so many of them.<p>(Joe) Well, you know people churn them out. But that's what I said: I said those books that you're reading is the kind of stuff YOU would put in a romance novel if you were writing one.<p>(L) Yes, if I wrote a romance novel, I would try to put that in.<p>(Joe) Yeah. You're an enlightened individual, and there are others out there who...<p>(L) So, somebody's on a mission to try to... Well, the thing is now... Some of these other books that were not really directly related to this topic. They bring up social issues, and they bring up all kinds of situations that really, really need attention. But what I noticed about some of them... This Georgia Le Carre, she's not too bad. But there's so many that have such HORRIBLE grammar and syntax. They use malapropisms just repeatedly and continuously. They don't have control of their verbs in particular. Like sit, sat, sitting, stands, standing, stood. That sort of thing. They'll say, "He was stood by the door" when it should be, "He was STANDING by the door."<p>(Artemis) He was stood-standing! [laughter]<p>(Joe) That's British English.<p>(Niall) Northern England.<p>(L) So that could just be an artifact of there…<p>(Joe) Yeah!<p>(L) Okay, so that would explain that, but then there are malapropisms that are really outrageous... Like using the word 'abstruse' instead of 'obtuse'. That just absolutely does not fit. So it's as though they've heard a word, and they think they know what the word is, but they don't really know what the word is, but they write it anyway because it sounds fancy. It's like the way Violette used to write. And I said to her that if you don't know what the word means... And she would say, "Well, people will know what I'm saying!" That was her answer to me, and it just kinda blew my mind. The educational level of some of the authors of these novels is just deplorably low...<p>(Joe) But to have that imagination...<p>(L) Yes, they have the imagination to tell a story. If you can edit out in your head as you're reading, you can actually enjoy the story if you don't let it bother you too much. But I'm just flabbergasted at all the books being put out there in this genre that exhibit the authors’ ignorance so blatantly. Most of them don’t even appear to do any research at all.<p>(Artemis) It's the price you pay: You're really good at one thing, or you're really good at another.<p>(L) But I started wondering if they were using some kind of software to write these stories... Except the stories have creative elements.<p>(Joe) I'm familiar with those colloquialisms of different dialects of British English. That's common! There are millions of people who talk like that every day to each other.<p>(Pierre) Do you know more about this Georgia author?<p>(L) No, I don't know anything more. I just know Joe looked into her and she started writing and wrote like 50 books since then. 2014 remember is when that blow-up happened over there in Ukraine, and I said that was the beginning of the end.<p>(Andromeda) Maybe she just saw what was going on and she also had this thing for writing romances.<p>(L) Well, the thing is that what they're doing is they're using this romance novel thing to get under the radar.<p>(Pierre) Oh yeah, it's a perfect cover.<p>(Joe) If that's your way of communicating your thoughts and ideas, then you're gonna put it in. Like I said, in the same way you would if you wrote a romance novel.<p>(L) Well, lemme ask this: Despite the fact that these books are a little more than slightly racy (to me they're EXTREMELY racy), is it still okay for people to read them? I felt a little iffy about even recommending it except for the fact that it had all this stuff about computers, transhumanism, the evil empire, the secret rulers of the world and so forth.<p class="answer">A: Those with good mental and spiritual hygiene will be fine and even benefited by this reading.<p>Q: (Joe) The problem is that people who aren't like that, it might give them ideas and they'll go out and look for a Russian don...<p class="answer">A: Warnings to the wise.<p>Q: (L) In other words, give warnings and the wise will take the warnings. Those who don't take the warnings, well... What can you do?<p>(Artemis) Something to remember is that romance and sex is how you give people information.<p class="answer">A: Note how similar in dynamics the books in question are to your beloved regency stories!<p>Q: (L) Well, that's a good point. Some of these stories, I mean... In the Regency stories, the bad guy gets killed in a duel or sword fight. There's almost like vigilante justice effected by the hero of the story. In these more modern ones, they set it as mafia dons or something and they just blow the evil doers away! It's just the modern version of it.<p>(Joe) A modern more graphic twist on the Regency Romance novels.<p>(L) Except for a few that were really excessive, they all seem to be about true love, everlasting love, faithfulness, and fidelity. In the modern books, they're ALL rakes. In the Regency ones, they're rakes too. So, I guess six of one, half a dozen of the other. Okay, so I'm okay.<p>(Joe) In the US, there are certain states - notably Florida and Texas - which have been exemplary in their pushback against this Covid nonsense. They didn't lock down, they opened and returned to normal more quickly, etc. That's kind of strange in a sense because you wouldn't expect that to come from the US - or at least we wouldn't. My point is that right now and over the past year, Florida and Texas were good places to live given what people in most places in the Western world were subjected to. So my question is: What's the prognosis for places like Florida and Texas?<p class="answer">A: Suppression will be attempted...<p>Q: (L) Alright, I think we've covered what we had to cover, right?<p>(Joe) "Suppression will be attempted..."<p>(Andromeda) But not necessarily successful.<p>(Joe) Revolution?<p class="answer">A: Exactly. Remember the Alamo!!<p>Q: (Joe) I hope so. I wanna see SOMEBODY do something. If it's gonna happen anywhere, it's gonna happen in America.<p>(Niall) Trump's coming back!<p>(Joe) 1776 will rise again!... [laughter]<p>(L) Is there anything we need to know or ask? Consider it asked to help us out through this turmoil...<p class="answer">A: Things will get worse before they get better. Stay alert and use knowledge!!! Goodbye.<p>END OF SESSION</div></br></div></section><section id="1631923200"><div class="main"><h2>Session 18 September 2021</h2><a href="https://cassiopaea.org/forum/threads/session-18-september-2021.51079/" target="_blank">Forum discussion</a></br></br><div>Session Date: September 18th 2021<p>Laura, Andromeda, and Artemis at the board<p>Pierre, Joe, Chu, Ark, PoB, Scottie, Niall, Gaby, Noko the Wonderdog, Princess Leia, Pikabu the Cat<p>Q: (L) Today is September 18, 2021. The usual suspects: [Review of those present] Okay, let's begin. Hello. Is anybody out there?<p class="answer">A: Gloriaea in excelsis!<p>Q: (L) Is that your name?<p class="answer">A: First part will serve.<p>Q: (L) So, Gloriaea. And you just added the 'in excelsis' to that?<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (Artemis) We already had a Gloriaea at the board.<p>(L) It's from a song.<p>(Chu) It's a latin thing.<p>["Gloria in excelsis Deo" is Latin for "Glory to God in the highest"]<p>(L) So, as Gaby pointed out, what I said before the session is a question. I can't think of a specific question that I want to ask, except for the fact that I feel the need for a session because things are so strange. I feel this building sensation of inner stress - like a tension. Waiting for the other shoe to drop. Something like that. So, what's going on?<p class="answer">A: Now would be a good time to ponder the lessons contained in the Parable of the Sower.<p>[Summary]<p>The Parable of the Sower (sometimes called the Parable of the Soils) is a parable of Jesus found in Matthew 13:1–23, Mark 4:1–20, Luke 8:4–15 and the extra-canonical Gospel of Thomas.[1]<p>Again Jesus began to teach by the lake. The crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake, while all the people were along the shore at the water’s edge. He taught them many things by parables, and in his teaching said: “Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain. Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, some multiplying thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times.”<p>Then Jesus said, “Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.”<p>When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables. He told them, “The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables so that,“‘they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!’”<p>Then Jesus said to them, “Don’t you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable? The farmer sows the word. Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them. Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy. But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away. Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word; but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful. Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop—some thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times what was sown.”<p>Q: (L) Well, I wrote about it in From Paul to Mark. There was somebody who was giving a really interesting interpretation whose work I cited. It was his deduction from his analysis of the text that the Parable of the Sower was one of the secrets of the Kingdom of God which was that there were different types of human beings and that they simply were that way by their very nature. But at the same time, the wiles of the devil were always working, too. So there are people of different types. Any further comment on that? We can discuss it on the forum.<p class="answer">A: These are the times that try men's souls. And perhaps now you can understand the full meaning of that statement. Some souls do not do well under stress and pressure and the human system is constructed to alleviate stress by whatever means necessary.<p>Q: (L) Well, I guess that's pretty much a description of what we see around us.<p>(Andromeda) That's something I've been thinking a lot about lately, actually.<p>(L) Most people simply can't handle the stress or pressure, and they make whatever rationalizations they need to themselves to give up or change their course or to justify whatever... Anything to get rid of their stress, any kind of feeling bad.<p>(Joe) Is getting vaccinated one way that people are alleviating that stress?<p class="answer">A: Indeed.<p>Q: (Pierre) And this tension I think is this divide between those kinds of souls and the other ones. The chasm is widening because I think the vaccine reinforces this way of wishfully thinking.<p>(Joe) Just believing a lie does that.<p>(L) There are other ways, I mean... People who think that resisting the vaccine to the death is the only way to go, for example.<p>(Andromeda) That's not the only way to resist.<p>(L) And becoming wild radicals is not a good idea. Well, certainly there are people who are suited to being radical and doing things that may end up being violent or something. That's not our way. I think that for us, it's not the right way. So, I dunno... Just a lot to think about. How do different souls fit into different categories on both sides of the equation: pro-vaccine AND anti-vaccine? Alright, any further questions on that?<p>(Gaby) Is there any reason why they have this deadline of the 15th of October to get everyone vaccinated? Is there a reason?<p class="answer">A: Changes are coming and they know it.<p>Q: (L) As in climate changes, or planetary changes, or Earth changes, or somewhere in that category?<p class="answer">A: Yes. Close.<p>Q: (Artemis) What about aliens?<p class="answer">A: Close<p>Q: (Artemis) Close to aliens and close to Earth changes, okay! Earth-changing aliens!<p>(L) I have to say that people who have been willingly vaccinated are probably gonna be the aliens! [laughter]<p>(Andromeda) Alien zombies!<p>(L) But for those who believe the vaccine is the solution...<p>(Joe) Yeah, but not for those who know what it is and took steps to protect themselves.<p>(Artemis) Is Cthulhu coming to smite people for their insolence?<p class="answer">A: Close<p>Q: (L) Close! Jesus... [laughter] Okay, questions?<p>(Joe) A year and a half ago, they gave a time frame of about 2 years for some kind of a REAL pandemic or viral outbreak. There's a lot of evidence that the mRNA vaccinations especially are actually suppressing people's immune systems. Is the C's time frame still correct? Those who are weakened would be very vulnerable to a real virus. Are we still on track maybe next spring for that kind of thing?<p class="answer">A: Close enough. Things are soon to get more dramatic. Be glad of the period of relatively controlled mayhem.<p>Q: (L) In other words, what we've been going through where it seems like we're just waiting, waiting, waiting to see what's gonna happen, we're gonna look back on this as a rest period?!<p class="answer">A: Close<p>Q: (Andromeda) It seems like we're waiting, waiting, waiting for something bad to happen. Well, that's what you're doing... [laughter]<p>(L) Next question?<p>(Pierre) How many people on the planet were killed by the Covid vaccines?<p>(Chu) Well, you can't even get a proper answer to that because what if there are other factors?<p>(L) Yeah, I don't think I'd ask those kinds of questions.<p>(Niall) Which vaccines? How sick were they before getting them?<p>(L) Too many variables. You'd have to break it down.<p>(Joe) Well, I dunno... It could be pretty clear cut. You might have people who would have lived this many times longer, except they didn't because of the vaccine...<p>(L) Okay, rephrase the question.<p>(Joe) How many people globally died so far where the vaccine was the main contributing factor to their death?<p class="answer">A: 200k or thereabouts.<p>Q: (Niall) Somebody out there came up with that figure.<p>(Andromeda) It's almost 7 times what they reported officially.<p>(Pierre) They said 37,000 in the West.<p>(Andromeda) But with a margin of error where it could be 10 times higher.<p>(Joe) There's a lot of articles in the past two weeks about rumors of food shortages this winter due to various reasons. It's not just high food prices, but food shortages. Lots of reasons are given: the Covid thing, destruction of business, fuel shortages, etc. Is that something that's likely to...?<p class="answer">A: Weather destruction of food sources has been covered up by fake news.<p>Q: (L) So it's worse than they let on?<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (Joe) They're just holding back a flood, ya know? But it's gonna reach a breaking point.<p>(L) So, it's time for the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse!<p class="answer">A: You can hear the hoof beats in the distance.<p>Q: (L) Oooh! [laughter]<p>(Andromeda) That's dramatic!<p>(L) What about the creature you mentioned earlier?<p>(Artemis) Cthulhu?<p>(L) Does he ride a horse?<p>(Pierre) He's from H.P. Lovecraft novels.<p>(Artemis) Next they're gonna say Satan's gonna rise up from the Earth! [laughter]<p>(Andromeda) With fire shooting out of his eyes! Creepy!<p>(L) We're just batting a thousand tonight! [laughter] Next question?<p>(Pierre) The organ where scientists found the highest concentration of the COVID vaccine is the ovaries. Is that by design?<p class="answer">A: Not human intent, but influences from other realms have that as a goal.<p>Q: (Artemis) So why the ovaries?<p>(Chu) Because it reduces fertility.<p>(L) And creates mutations. A new race.<p>(Pierre) Is one of the objectives to create a new race?<p class="answer">A: Close<p>Q: (L) Another experiment on the human race...<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (L) That reminds me: A long time ago, we asked a question about how all of humanity fell or became entrapped in 3d... They said something about how DNA became modified and certain factors being canceled in the DNA. It was all being done simultaneously. It was something about light doing it. We'll have to find the exact excerpt. But the thing is that, in a certain sense, technically speaking that's almost what they're doing right now. And when you figure out that alien technology is still somewhat material, then you wonder what happened back then. Was there some kind of vaccine that they gave everybody back then?<p>(Artemis) I've also noticed that people who have taken vaccines think that vaccines are good. So I think vaccines make people think that vaccines are good.<p>(L) Well, they have to think they're good because they invest themselves in them.<p>(Andromeda) Yeah, they have to justify their decisions.<p>(L) Alright. Next question?<p>(Joe) Is Michelle Obama a man? [laughter]<p class="answer">A: No<p>Q: (L) Oh rats! I was SO sure! I was so sure she was! [laughter] Michael Obama. Next question? Anybody brave enough?<p>(Artemis) So they said the vaccine affects the ovaries. Hasn't it already been found before that it affects the pineal or pituitary glands? And isn't the pineal or pituitary used for picking up channeling frequencies?<p>(L) Probably both.<p>(Artemis) So does that mean that vaccines make it so people pick up negative frequencies?<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (Artemis) So that means people who've been vaccinated are channeling Satan. [laughter] Okay, that's extreme, but...<p>(L) They can definitely download some weird stuff. But only those susceptible, I think.<p>(Pierre) On this line, the RNA in the vaccine code is for a protein very similar to syncytin. Mis-expression of this protein syncytin leads to disorders like schizophrenia that are considered by some researchers as possession. So my question is: Can the vaccine in some cases increase the incidence of actual possession?<p class="answer">A: Oh indeed!!<p>Q: (Artemis) [in a demonic voice] 'The vaccine is preparing the vessels!' [laughter]<p>(L) This is just getting creepier by the minute!<p>(Pierre) Remember the session where the C's said they're preparing to control you in 4th density?<p>(L) That's their goal.<p>(Joe) They also said that Hitler's goal of creating a Master Race was just a trial run...<p>(L) Oh Jesus... I never thought about that.<p>(Joe) He didn't have vaccines mind you, but... If you want to create a new race or to change people by the billions, you have to inject them with DNA. They're basically being injected with DNA.<p>(Pierre) But is it working exactly according to their plan?<p>(Joe) Well, they said already about mutations and stuff.<p>(Pierre) I would like to know why the 3rd dose, 4th dose, 5th dose... Is it only to...<p>(Joe) That's to cover up the fact that it's not working.<p class="answer">A: They keep hitting snags. It's not nice to try to control Mother Nature.<p>Q: (L) So Mother Nature... Nature is getting in the way.<p>(Artemis) Are there some kind of ignorant innocent people who can be spared this if they're forced to get the vaccine? Can they be protected in some way just simply by their soul essence?<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (Artemis) Well, that's good. Some people are just kind and sweet, and they're just doing it because they have to.<p>(L) Yeah.<p>(Joe) What percentage of the global population can see this more or less for what it is: something evil or wrong?<p class="answer">A: 12 percent.<p>Q: (Niall) We said 10%.<p>(Pierre) It's interesting because it's the exact number, 12%, of health workers in France that preferred to be fired than to be injected.<p>(L) 12 percent. Interesting.<p>(Artemis) It's also forcing the smart people to make themselves known. You notice how they want your ID more and more on web sites. They want to know who everybody is and where they are.<p>(L) Anybody got any more questions?<p>(Ark) Me. I was playing with my model of superluminal communication. I would like to know about this 'We are you in the future'. Can it be said that it's like 100-200 years in the future, or 1000-2000 years, or... Can I have an estimation of how far in the future in numbers? If it can be said. Not exact, but a range.<p class="answer">A: It can vary, but usually under 1k years or too much signal corruption.<p>Q: (L) Less than 1000 years.<p>(Pierre) I'm trying to reconcile the AD timeline of history and the BP timeline, ice cores and dendrochronology. There seems to be one matching marker at 536 AD - a year without summer, very cold, very bad weather - seemingly matching the 1500 BP mark with a converging cooling all over the planet revealed by ice cores and tree rings. So my question is: Is it a real match?<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (Pierre) In a previous session you mentioned about 470 years added between us and Julius Caesar. If it matches, it means these 470 years were added before 536 AD?<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (Pierre) It means Caesar died about 70 years before this 536 event?<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (Pierre) Wow. It means there's no late or middle Roman Empire!<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (Pierre) Everything is collapsing. Yes, yes, yes. It's all gone. That's what we thought.<p>(L) And documents were faked to fill in the gap.<p>(Niall) Fake emperors and stuff.<p>(Joe) If there's a kind of rough mirror in this go-round, first Caesar and then a Dark Ages and collapse... And then in our era, a close match might be JFK as this era's Caesar. 1963. Plus 70 years is 2033.<p>(Pierre) Oh, I see what you mean.<p>(Niall) So 70 years after Caesar's death. So it's 44 BC. What's 44 + 70? So it's right after the fall, kaboom, it's gone. In fact, Paul didn't live very long.<p>(Pierre) Kaboom, and you transition to the Justinian plague.<p>(L) So in other words, Paul was right: the end of the world WAS coming?<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (Pierre) And the 2 or 3 missing centuries after the Justinian plague, they were not made up. They were there, but there was nothing going on because everybody was dead!<p>(L) Yeah, 90% death rate in the archaeology around Rome.<p>(Joe) Does that mean that JFK and Laura are this era's Caesar and Paul? [laughter]<p>(L) Oh, stop it! [laughter]<p>(Joe) Well, answer the question!<p class="answer">A: Silly!<p>Q: (Joe) Silly? That means yes.<p>(Niall) But when was the Jewish War then? And Josephus? That would have to be AFTER the collapse...<p>(Joe) Where's your Jewish War, Laura?<p>(L) I don't think there was a Jewish War.<p>(Joe) Somebody could have just been writing a fairytale...<p>(L) There was stuff going on at that time, like rebellion, but... Sorting out that MESS would be a labor of Hercules. I mean, Hercules was asked to clean the Augean stables. He was not asked to refill them. [laughter]<p>(Joe) All those events can be... I mean, you take events that happened in our recent history and you imagine someone chronicling that, you could expand that out over a long period of time. The amount of stuff that has happened if you took discrete events over the past 20 years, you could expand those out over a long period of time if you want.<p>(L) Sure. You could just write stuff and make some editorial changes, add stuff, re-use stories, and... I mean, look what I found that happened with Gregory of Tours vs. the Eastern Empire records. The whole history of Gregory of Tours fits into a slot that is completely blank in the records of the Eastern Empire. It's as though they stole that material and used it to write his history. God, how many times did they do that... Alright, anybody else have any questions? I'm getting depressed. [laughter]<p>(Chu) I have a related one. With all this fudging of history, is it true that there was never any vulgar Latin, and the chronology as it's depicted is wrong?<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (L) It affects everything - EVERYTHING. It's like a falling domino. It's enough to make you want to run out of the house screaming!<p>(PoB) I have a question. Was seeding Communism at the beginning of the 19th century more or less a rehearsal to what seems to be developing now?<p class="answer">A: Partly. It is all part of the bigger picture.<p>Q: (L) Anything else?<p>(Artemis) Do you remember that link that you sent me about the 'Well to Hell' or whatever in the Middle East?<p>(Joe) It's in... Yemen.<p>(Artemis) Is there anything strange down there?<p class="answer">A: Not really.<p>Q: (Artemis) So people there are just paranoid for no reason.<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (Joe) I have a question for you, Laura. Where's Caesar buried?<p>(L) Caesar was burned.<p>(Joe) Doesn't he have a little urn somewhere?<p>(L) Maybe, but if so, it was probably put in the same tomb that Augustus built. But then that was ransacked at the time of the barbarian invasions.<p>(Joe) And destroyed? So there's no reference and nobody knows of any particular place?<p>(L) We can't go find any pieces of Caesar, no.<p>(Joe) No, but a rough area where he was buried.<p>(L) Probably people gathered his ashes or took pieces home or whatever. He was burned in the center of Rome in that place that we saw when we were there. That was supposedly the place where he was burned.<p>(Joe) So that's pretty much his burial site.<p>(L) Yeah.<p>(Artemis) Do the potential supernatural negative effects of human vaccines also apply to animal vaccines?<p class="answer">A: Not so much since animal vaccines are not so loaded with negative elements.<p>Q: (L) So they're just trying to make a vaccine for animals without...<p>(Artemis) Without possessing the animals!<p>(L) Yeah, without piggybacking control elements onto it. Alright... If there's anything we failed to ask that we should have asked but were too shell-shocked to ask, please let us know!<p class="answer">A: Just keep eyes and ears open and SEE! Goodbye.<p>(L) Well, I guess things are about to get real...

Fiooniaea of Cassiopaea here for the end of the world party!!!<p>Q: (Andromeda) Well alright! [laughter]<p>(Artemis) I feel like we should be having a DJ as well, or something.<p>(Laura) A DJ? Alright. You see how things get going around here? It just gets crazy sometimes. [laughter] Okay, who's got questions? [silence] Oh! We're having a session and nobody has any questions?<p>Q: (Pierre) I have a question: Were the genetic modifications induced by the Black Death virus the main cause of the Renaissance?<p class="answer">A: Not main, but contributory.<p>Q:(Laura) Well, what was the main cause?<p class="answer">A: 4D influences of a psychic nature.<p>Q: (Joe) What is driving global governments to officially pursue a transformation to green energy, dropping fossil fuels, and investing in renewables?<p class="answer">A: Destruction of lives.<p>Q: (L) You know, that's interesting... I was reading something on the forum today. It was on that thread of alternative 3, for anybody who has read it. Oh no, no no! It was that video, "The Dinosaur". And the Dinosaur said, "Evil governments are investing in fossil fuels". And then it turns around and says, "you need green, sustainable blah blah blah". And it just occurred to me it would take a long period of time to get other forms of energy going. But fossil fuels are the most efficient thing right now, to help in poverty stricken countries. By forcing them to wait on alternative green sources of energy, you're just extending their dying time! So, it's a complete contradiction.<p>(Joe) Well, not only that, windmills, wind turbines and solar power, they can't replace the world's energy needs. They simply can't. And no government can possibly be sincere in their belief that they can. So that's why I'm asking the question. Do they really believe it?<p>(L) No, I think it's...<p>(Niall) They don't, so the follow-up question is, are governments consciously trying to destroy lives?<p class="answer">A: Yes.<p>Q: (Niall) Crikey!<p>(L) Yeah, I think they are becoming quite conscious at this point.<p>(Niall) It's funny, because Bill Gates came out today and said, "In the short term, we need to keep nuclear power going, because the backlash from the public during this transition to renewables is strong".<p>(Joe) They're going to destroy the global economy. You can't transition in the period of time they're talking about.<p>(Niall) But at least he was astute enough to say it.<p>(Laura) If they were really going to transition, they should have started back in the 70s when people started talking about this sort of thing.<p>(Joe) Do you know the UK had an energy shortage this year? Do you know why?<p>(Laura) Why?<p>(Joe) Because they didn't get any, or very little power from the windmills because this year the wind didn't blow strong enough. That's the energy they're investing in. They're going to fuel the world with windmills. That suggests they are kind of on board with a population reduction idea, this big "conspiracy theory" of depopulation... that governments are on board with that, and that they're saying, "OK, let's basically switch over to this crazy new energy source that will only be able to sustain a limited amount of people on the planet, and the rest of them will die.<p>(Andromeda) Yeah, in the beginning we could have thought that maybe it was greed, that they were trying to make money, but at this point it's so obvious that that is not going to work.<p>(Joe) You can try to make money with a little bit here and there... But it's not even going to work. 60 percent of China's energy comes from coal right now. Do you think they're ever going to be able to build enough windmills that will actually work... with volcanoes going off, and reduced sunlight and that kind of stuff... it's just not possible.<p>(Niall) Are China and Russia on board with this?<p>(Joe) They are, officially.<p class="answer">A: Not deeply.<p>Q: (Laura) I notice China and Russia aren't going to this Climate conference...<p>(Joe) ...in Scotland.<p>(L) So they're giving it a pass, so maybe they are starting to feel comfortable with giving a pass to other things, I don't know. Okay, next question.<p>(Joe) About 10 years ago, at around the time of the global banking crisis/crash, some time after that, in 2010 maybe... For some reason we were asking, thinking that the economy was going to implode, or something... And we asked that question, and it was right at this time of the year. "Are they going to crash the economy soon?" And the C's said, "They might wait till after Christmas". And of course, nothing happened in the 10 years since then. So I was just wondering if that idea of "after Christmas" applies to...<p>(Andromeda) ...this Christmas? [laughter].<p class="answer">A: Possible.<p>Q: (Scottie) Just wait 10 years and we'll find out.<p>(Chu) People have started posting questions on the Zoom chat.<p>(Laura) Oh good job! Hold on people, let's see:<p>(eboard10) Someone on Twitter (Canadian earthquake researcher) predicts that a 10+ earthquake with the epicenter around the Philippines will hit between now and mid-2023 due to the release of an existing blocking of tectonic plates. How likely is that to happen?<p class="answer">A: 26%<p>Q: (Joe) We like those odds.<p>(Laura) Now, of course you could start going and naming other places and other date frames, and all that sort of thing, and we could take hours and hours going through all of that sort of thing, but I don't like doing that. That's why I don't like this kind of question.<p>(Joe) You could just ask what area of the globe has a higher chance of having a major earthquake in the next six months.<p>(Abats) What about the famous April Drop Dead date?<p class="answer">A: Coming!<p>Q: (Laura) [reading Zoom chat] Some people can't hear Joe. All you people are really going to have to speak up for the microphone. Can everybody hear me? Wave your hand if you can. Okay, that's probably because I'm close to the microphone.<p>(Scottie) That was a microphone problem, but we fixed it.<p>(genero81) Should we ask about Gary?<p>(Laura) No, I don't think so.<p>(Drea) Let's hope that someone releases free energy technology.<p>(Laura) That's assuming that something like that even exists. I don't think you get anything for free in this universe.<p>(Mexican House) What is the real percentage of vaccination in the world? Did they reach their numbers in October?<p>(Laura) I think we already asked that question at a previous session.<p>(Niall) We did. We took the example of France and asked if the official numbers were close to reality, and they said yes.<p>(Lainey) It would be lovely to know if Gary is well.<p>(Laura) Okay, other people want to know, so we'll ask about Gary.<p>(Artemis) Maybe we can ask if Gary wants to share anything with us.<p>(Laura) Well, that's a bit too much.<p>(Artemis) Okay, never mind.<p>(Laura) You have to go through this whole song and dance to do that. They have to re-route the channel, sign off and sign on. It's a switching problem!<p>(Artemis) They can relay the message themselves.<p>(Laura) Okay, we want to know if Gary is okay.<p class="answer">A: Yes, thanks to knowledge and prayers.<p>Q: (nicklebleu and his wife): It has been said that wind has decreased in recent times. Is that true?<p class="answer">A: In some places. Has increased in others. Also it is more compacted.<p>Q: (Laura) Well, I would imagine that if the climate is changing, you know, moving towards an Ice Age, or whatever it has to go through in order to get there, it's going to change. Climate change in the past, as they've been able to determine by retrospective studies... Places that formerly had rain, no longer have rain, and places that didn't have rain start getting rain. And I guess, places that didn't have wind start getting wind, and places that used to have wind don't get wind... So it's all about the changes going on.<p>(Joe) Which is useless for windmills.<p>(Andromeda) Pretty much, yeah.<p>(Laura) Yeah, they're basing a lot of their so-called "green" activities on situations that existed in the past, and that are no longer going to be existing.<p>(Madara Horseman) Speaking about energy news, we are bombarded with nuclear fusion. Are the different countries really looking for a solution there, or are they mostly hyping and diverting money? Are we close to nuclear fusion in a practical sense, or...?<p>(Laura) Hmm, that's not a well formed question. It's hard to break that down. Okay, let me see. Nuclear fusion: Are different countries really looking for a solution, or are they mostly hyping and diverting?<p class="answer">A: Both.<p>Q: (Laura) Are we close to nuclear fusion in a practical sense?<p class="answer">A: Could be.<p>Q: (Laura) Could be - if they really put their minds to it. Okay, here is a question on another topic:<p>(Ryu) Why are some countries (India, Japan, many African countries) "allowed" to use Ivermectin?<p class="answer">A: Not allowed, but conducting experiments.<p>Q: (Ant22) What are the real vaccination levels in the UK, EU and US?<p>(Laura) I don't want to ask any more questions about vaccination levels. Don't we have figures on that, and don't we know that it's going to be less than what they are telling us?<p>(Joe) Or roughly what they say. That's the depressing part.<p>(MK Scarlett) In 1972, the Club of Rome wrote a book known as Report Meadows that was about green development and sustainable future, but it was all about depopulation. See the article: What is the “Global Public-Private Partnership”?<p class="answer">A: Exactly. That is the hidden agenda.<p>Q: (Ellipse) Does the DNA vaccine lower the immune system? If yes, how much [he wrote: "If yes, until which point"]?<p>(Laura) Hmm, I'd say all of the vaccines damage the immune system.<p>(Joe) So, on that other point, Laura, overt governments that are pushing this green agenda, are they aware that the agenda is population reduction? Is that it, they don't have any other rationale for it? Do they have any other reason for it, or is it just the destructive principle, and they want to kill people?<p class="answer">A: They are operating on the premise that there is a real threat to the planet and that the cause is overpopulation.<p>Q: (L) Well, I would say that overpopulation only threatens the population, not the planet. The planet can and will recover, but it's like any of the population studies: when there are too many rabbits...<p>(Andromeda) Disease comes along.<p>(L) Foxes come along to eat them.<p>(Joe) Maybe they think that overpopulation is a threat to society in the sense that it's unsustainable in the long term. If you don't do anything about it, people will die because there's not enough...<p>(L) I don't think they're worried about people dying.<p>(Niall) It's a threat to psychopathic rule.<p>(L) Yeah. Oh boy... We're in a helluva mess, people.<p>(Pierre) By enforcing those measures aimed at reducing population, they create oppression that triggers natural catastrophes before their plan is put in place.<p>(L) So you're saying that by...<p>(Pierre) Depopulation agenda entails a lot of lies. By those lies aiming to reduce population, they actually induce cosmically this population reduction.<p>(L) Yeah. Well, the thing is that then they've lost control of the narrative and they've lost control of who gets depopulated and who doesn't. They bring the very thing that they wished on other people on themselves. I mean, the C's did say it was a triple-bad day for John D. Rockefeller and his type.<p>(Pierre) Economically, biologically, socially, and also FRV. But is it true what we say? That they precipitate the cosmic reaction for manufacturing human suffering. Is it true?<p>(L) Yeah.<p>(Pierre) Okay.<p>(L) Okay...<p>(Redrock12) Will I eventually be cured of my prostate cancer?<p>(L) Ya know Redrock, that's a personal question. But guess what? I'm gonna give it to you.<p class="answer">A: Control!!!<p>Q: (L) Okay, they say, "control". You'll be able to control it. You may yet get it so controlled that it's almost like not even there, especially if you take care of your diet and supplements.<p>(Soluna) If you catch Covid via shedding from a vaccinated person, are you more or less likely to have the possible positive changes?<p>(L) Okay, so... That's assuming that a vaccinated person will have positive mutations. So let's break this down.<p>(Gaby) Is it possible to have a positive mutation from the vaccines?<p class="answer">A: Efforts were made to prevent that, so it would be rare.<p>Q: (L) So efforts were made to prevent the possibility of a vaccine producing a positive mutation.<p>(Andromeda) So then, if you caught the virus from somebody who was shedding after being vaccinated, it would probably be difficult as well.<p>(Joe) Which is the whole point of the vaccines, right? Originally in previous sessions, they said the virus got out and they expected it to have this effect on people but it had positive mutations. So then they rolled out the vaccination campaign to prevent the positive mutations from the lab-created virus.<p>(L) Didn't we read that book [Genetic Entropy, by John C. Sanford] that said the only real mutations that are observed in a laboratory are negative? They're like entropic... Well, anyway.<p>(Deckard) Is Nano soma really capable of balancing the whole body?<p class="answer">A: No<p>Q: (L) That was short.<p>(Regulattor) What % of death rate are we to expect next spring due to corona virus mutation/recombination?<p class="answer">A: Impossible to estimate at this point.<p>Q: (L) Okay.<p>(Mrs. Peel) How much longer before, or will they declare Joe Biden incapable of holding the office?<p class="answer">A: Never! But fate may intervene!<p>Q: (L) I mean, think about it: The guy is a dithering idiot, which leaves all the bureaucrats and hidden agenda people in the secret services and whatever TOTALLY in charge. He's nothing but their puppet. That's why they hated Trump so much. He wasn't their puppet and he was really trying to do something. He didn't realize what he was up against when he got in there, and they sure did block him off every way they could. But boy, they got Joe Biden now, and he's their honey!<p>(hesperides) Is the La Palma volcano activity going to increase a lot more?<p class="answer">A: Eventually.<p>Q: (L) Eventually, but we don't know when!<p>(Arwenn) What is the real purpose of all the Quarantine camps being built in Australia?<p>(L) Well, that's when people start getting real rowdy from the lack of food. So, that's pretty simple. We can answer that one.<p>(seeker2seer) Will the soon to hit solar flare tonight or tomorrow cause more problems for the electrical grid than normal due to the decrease of Earth's magnetic field?<p class="answer">A: Not terribly.<p>Q: (L) Does anybody know what class it is?<p>(Pierre) X-class. X1.<p>(L) So, it's not much. We've already had a few.<p>(Madara Horseman) Can the Pfizer shot affect any part of our consciousness?<p class="answer">A: Indirectly if susceptible.<p>Q: (L) And the second part of the question:<p>(Madara Horseman) And if yes, can any meditation, chant, or any technospirituality method allow us to use the influences?<p>(L) We've already got a thread on how to counteract that, and we already know that knowledge and all that kind of stuff works.<p>(logos5x5) Is the prediction of "Mexico Falls" related to a major earthquake, a series of significant earth changes events, or something else entirely?<p class="answer">A: Earthquake.<p>Q: (Tristan) What about the volcanoes around the world, especially on the island of La Palma where explosive activity continues? Are more eruptions expected?<p>(L) We kinda covered that.<p>(Mark7) Was Mark a woman?<p>(L) Oh! Yeah, so you read the book, huh? You read my speculations.<p class="answer">A: No. But the author of the first passion play honoring Caesar was.<p>Q: (Andrian) I would like to ask a question regarding the accuracy of the Russian astrologer Svetlana Dragan.<p class="answer">A: About the same as any good astrologer. It is a gift of interpreting symbols.<p>Q: (L) So that's kind of a left-handed way of saying she's a good astrologer.<p>(Altair, Cosmos, Gawan) Does Putin believe the official corona narrative?<p class="answer">A: No<p>Q: (Altair, Cosmos, Gawan) If not, has he caved in or is he attempting a long-term strategy behind the scenes in terms of corona?<p class="answer">A: Latter.<p>Q: (Keit) So far Russia, despite various restrictions, has lower levels of corona craziness in comparison to other countries. Should we expect Russia to catch up also because of low vaccination rates?<p>(L) Are you asking if Russia is going to have more coronavirus cases because they're not...<p>(Keit) More corona craziness.<p>(L) Oh, so are they gonna become more like Western countries because they've been slack so far...<p class="answer">A: No.<p>Q: (Keit) Will mandatory vaccination bill pass?<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (Keit) And will there be protests?<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (Ryu) Did Paul believe Yahweh was the same god as Caesar's or did he use the Jewish religion as a template for his message?<p class="answer">A: Latter.<p>Q: (L) I think he was just using the Jewish god as a stand-in. He didn't really have much in the way of anything to reference. At the time, there were all these different gods. Then of course the Jewish god was claiming to be the only high creator god. That's what Paul was working with.<p>(Ryu) And did he come back after his life in the Roman Empire?<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (Joe) Who did he come back as? Anybody notable?<p class="answer">A: No<p>Q: (Joe) He was just hanging out being a farmer or something.<p>(Alejo) Is overpopulation a myth, or are we really overpopulated?<p class="answer">A: Overpopulated.<p>Q: (Alejo) By trying to depopulate, they'll generate the chaos that will cause catastrophe... is what Pierre is saying?<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (whitecoast) If 4D STS rely on people for food, wouldn't they want as large (and sick/diminished) a population as possible? Or is the depopulation agenda just about spreading mass misery on the heels of earth changes that may reduce the population sharply anyway?<p>(L) Well, well remember that a large part of 4D STS food is the energy of pain and suffering. That gives them a huge psychic boost and advantage. So, that right there is a feeding mechanism. But we realize of course that they don't need the numbers of people that we have on the Earth for their feeding purposes. I don't think it's quite that bad. We know there are a LOT of people missing, unexplained things... Look at this 411 business. But also remember that the C's pointed out at one point that they had a fallback diet of... what was it? Bovine serum extracted from cows or something so they didn't have to take so much from humans.<p>(Altair, Cosmos, Gawan) Are the PTB priming the public to expect earth changes and their effects?<p class="answer">A: Somewhat.<p>Q: (L) Just not the way they're really gonna happen...<p>(Altair, Cosmos, Gawan) If so, are they attempting to make it look like humans are doing it?<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>Q: (Ant22) They said a positive mutation from the vaccine/shedding from a vaccinated person would be rare. What conditions would need to be met for it to happen?<p>(L) Oh, geez! What are you trying to DO to me?! [laughter] Well, lemme see... What conditions would need to be met for a positive mutation?<p class="answer">A: Elevated consciousness and knowledge/being.<p>Q: (L) Well, that's fairly rare. [laughter]<p>(Bo) In China, several people are already reported to have gotten the H5N6 bird flu. Would H5N6 be considered the true pandemic/plague to engulf the planet?<p class="answer">A: No<p>Q: (Juba) Is Paul the real name of "our" Paul?<p class="answer">A: No<p>Q: (Juba) If not, what was it?<p class="answer">A: Zacaria.<p>Q: (Juba) Are Mark, Matthew, and Luke real names, or behind them were some obscure groups of people?<p>(L) I suspect Mark might have been a real name. Matthew might have been a real name of somebody who was involved with the writing of Matthew. Then Luke may have been too, but there were also obscure groups of people about them. Read my book and that should become clear.<p>(Obi) What will be the death rate of the new space virus globally?<p>(L) In other words, if we get a new real genuine plague/pandemic/Black Death type of situation, what would the global death rate be?<p class="answer">A: 79%<p>Q: (Joe) That's IF we get one.<p>(L) I hope ya'll know how to drive bulldozers and operating excavators. That's a lot of bodies to get rid of! Don't wanna burn 'em and waste your fossil fuels! You might run out. [laughter] Bulldoze them and put the lime on them. That's what they did in the old days.<p>(Learner) In which places of Europe and the rest of the Western world is it most likely that people will wake up, network and help each other while facing ever tightening screws of Covid and other tyranny, black-outs, earth changes, etc.?<p class="answer">A: Pockets in many places.<p>Q: (L) There will be pockets in many places.<p>(Chu) 54 new messages.<p>(L) 54!!<p>(Joe) Laura? When the C's kind of advised you to move to France, did they not know that Florida was gonna be the last bastion of freedom 20 years later?<p>(L) I think they knew that other things were coming.<p>(Joe) Can we at least have some confirmation of that to make ourselves feel better? [laughter] We could have stayed in Florida and all be on the beach now... [laughter]<p class="answer">A: This work would not have survived and thrived there.<p>Q: (hlat) Why has Carson been hit by 2 earthquakes and an unexplainable terrible smell that is still going on for a month?<p class="answer">A: Fault.<p>Q: (L) Fault line.<p>(Joe) What's the probability of a big one in California in the next year?<p class="answer">A: 53%<p>Q: (L) So, that's almost half and half. That's nothing.<p>(Aragorn) Various investigators have found very weird stuff in the Covid vaccines, like parasite-like organisms. Is this by accident/contamination or have they inserted these on purpose? Or are these findings just disinformation?<p>(L) Let's break that down... Is it by accident, or have they inserted these things on purpose?<p class="answer">A: Purpose when present, but rare in fact.<p>(L) You guys are killin' me here tonight.<p>Q: (JEEP) Will mask mandates in blue cities/states ever go away?<p class="answer">A: Sure. Eventually...<p>Q: (Andromeda) Like when everybody's dead?<p>(Artemis) Maybe in 100 or 200 years. Nothing can last forever, right?<p>(Temperance) Do the NYC protests have any viable and realistic chance of reversing local mandates and starting a chain reaction (since some areas follow suit on NYC and are waiting to see what happens) or has that ship sailed?<p class="answer">A: Not unless they get a lot bigger.<p>Q: (L) Alright people... We're never gonna get through all these questions. I thought I was gonna answer everybody's questions but now there are 58 more! I mean nobody could think of anything when we started, and now we've got 58. Okay, hold on... [laughter]<p>(Mexican house) Could you give us some advice for small FOTCM Communities that are starting to develop around the world? Something important to keep in mind?<p>(Laura) We'll discuss that on the forum. Discuss it on the forum.<p>(Pophistorian) Some percentage of vaccine doses are suspected to be placebo. If true, what percentage?<p>(L) Are any of the vaccine doses placebo?<p class="answer">A: No.<p>(L) No, if you let 'em stick it in you, they wanna get ya. [laughter]<p>Q: (Vulcan59) Question by luigi rovatti in the forum: What happened to the Dutch girls Kris Kremers and Lisanne Froon who disappeared while hiking the El Pianista trail in Panama on 1st April 2014?<p>(L) Did they ever find the bodies, or did they just disappear? (Artemis) Hold on, they want to say something.<p class="answer">A: Gone to 5D.<p>Q: (Abats) Is the Sinopharm vaccine less harmful than the Sputnik one?<p>(Joe) They're about equal. Next. They're both attenuated viruses.<p>(Tomek) Is Macron gonna be re-elected in 2022?<p>(L) No. Next one. (Niall) Wait and see.<p>(SummerLite) Will the USA people correct the election process enough to kick out Democrats in 2022?<p>(Niall) No chance.<p>(L) No chance!<p>(Tristan) From which language do the Romance languages originate?<p>(Niall) The Rome. [laughter]<p>(L) Answer that, Chu.<p>(Chu) I dunno, I have the same question! It's not Iberian. It can't be.<p>(Niall) There's an assumption that they all come from one language.<p>(Chu) That's what I'm wondering: Is it one, or several?<p>(L) Skip that one. That needs a discussion, I mean, that one actually needs research.<p>(Josi) Will airlines have to back down from mandating vaccines for pilots and other employees, or will they actually be terminated?<p class="answer">A: There is going to be a lot of backing down, or there will be no one to run things.<p>Q: (Ryu) You said that around 12% of the world was seeing the Covid scam for what it was. Are those people 4D candidates?<p class="answer">A: Not necessarily.<p>Q: (Deckard) Is Nano soma beneficial in any significant way?<p>(L) I would say that it's probably beneficial in some way, but you need to do the research on it.<p>(Madara Horseman) How did the Atlanteans design crystals for different purposes?<p>(Laura) Jezus Christ! That would take hours.<p>(Mexican House) Who was the last Roman Emperor before the fall of the empire?<p>(Pierre) Justinian?<p>(L) Probably. Was it Justinian?<p class="answer">A: Yes<p>(Pierre) So the link between the oppression committed by Justinian and the cataclysm, including the plague, would hold up.<p>Q: (L) Bye, Vulcan! He's off to work. He works on Sundays. Skim through and see if there are any really good ones.<p>(cinnamon) Is it likely that the cold civil war in the US becomes a hot civil war in the next two years? If it is likely, who or what starts the shooting? Or ignore this, I feel bad for Laura's arm.<p>(L) Yeah, thank you! I wanna see who feels bad for my arm. Oh, cinnamon! Thank you, sweetheart!
